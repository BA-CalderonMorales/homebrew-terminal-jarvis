# Copilot Instructions for Homebrew Terminal Jarvis

This file contains specific instructions for GitHub Copilot when working on the homebrew-terminal-jarvis repository.

## Critical Code Standards

### **ABSOLUTELY AVOID EMOJIS IN CODE**
- **NO emojis in any shell scripts, YAML files, or code files**
- **NO emojis in commit messages generated by scripts**
- **NO emojis in log output from automated processes**
- **NO emojis in documentation files (*.md)**
- Emojis are only acceptable in:
  - User-facing messages in terminal output (when appropriate)
  - PR descriptions and issue templates (when appropriate)

### Code Quality Standards

1. **Shell Scripts (`scripts/` directory)**
   - Use `set -e` for error handling
   - Include comprehensive error checking
   - Use meaningful variable names in UPPERCASE for constants
   - Validate all external dependencies before use
   - Provide clear, emoji-free log messages

2. **GitHub Actions (`.github/` directory)**
   - Use semantic and descriptive step names
   - Include proper error handling
   - Use outputs for data passing between steps
   - Follow GitHub Actions best practices for security
   - Keep workflows DRY using composite actions

3. **Homebrew Formula (`Formula/` directory)**
   - Follow Homebrew formula conventions
   - Include proper test blocks
   - Use platform-specific conditionals (OS.mac?, OS.linux?)
   - Maintain consistent formatting and indentation

### Repository-Specific Guidelines

1. **Version Management**
   - Always validate version formats before processing
   - Use semantic versioning (x.y.z)
   - Strip 'v' prefixes when comparing versions

2. **Archive Handling**
   - Always verify archive URLs exist before downloading
   - Calculate and validate SHA256 checksums
   - Support both Mac and Linux platforms

3. **Git Operations**
   - Use descriptive commit messages without emojis
   - Target the `develop` branch for updates
   - Include version change details in commit messages

4. **Error Handling**
   - Provide clear error messages without emojis
   - Include context about what operation failed
   - Exit with appropriate error codes

### Automation Principles

1. **Idempotency**
   - Scripts should be safe to run multiple times
   - Check current state before making changes
   - Skip operations that are already completed

2. **Logging**
   - Use consistent logging prefixes (e.g., "Checking...", "Updating...")
   - Include relevant context in log messages
   - Avoid verbose output that clutters logs

3. **Dependencies**
   - Check for required tools (jq, curl, git) before use
   - Provide helpful installation instructions when deps are missing
   - Use system package managers when possible

## Examples

### Good (No Emojis in Code)
```bash
echo "Checking for latest version..."
echo "Formula updated successfully"
git commit -m "feat: update Terminal Jarvis to v1.2.3"
```

### Bad (Emojis in Code)
```bash
echo "Checking for latest version..."
echo "Formula updated successfully"
git commit -m "feat: update Terminal Jarvis to v1.2.3"
```

## Maintenance Notes

- This file should be updated when new coding standards are established
- All team members should be familiar with these guidelines
- Automated tools should enforce these standards where possible
- Regular audits should check for emoji usage in code files
